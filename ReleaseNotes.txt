configuration options based on asset type and class. Implemented fixed
asset depreciation calculation and GL posting.

There are a number of improvements to the Product data model with more
options for structured data and content across defined product classes.

Non Backward Compatible Changes:

  entry (removed ItemAsset variations) and expanded for payroll, etc.

  to data and code may be necessary to populate properly, see the notes
  in the comments under the Product entity in ProductDefinitionEntities.xml

  of the dimensionTypeEnumId field.
